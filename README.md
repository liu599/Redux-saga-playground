### C0. Definitions

- **Fork**: performs a non-blocking operation on the function passed.
- **Take**: pauses until action received.
- **Race**: runs effects simultaneously, then cancels them all once one finishes.
- **Call**: runs a function. If it returns a promise, pauses the saga until the promise is resolved.
- **Put**: dispatches an action.
- **Select**: Runs a selector function to get data from the state
- **takeLatest**: means we are going to execute the operations, then return only the results of the last one call. If we trigger several cases, itâ€™s going to ignore all of them except the last one.
- **takeEvery**: will return results for all the calls triggered.

### C1. Make sequence calls

### C2. Non-blocking (Synchronously)
